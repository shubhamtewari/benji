Benji a productivity app, aimed at intentional, minimalist journaling.
Benji is named after Benjamin Franklin, a writer, printer, political philosopher, politician, freemason, postmaster, scientist, inventor, humorist, civic activist, statesman, and diplomat - a man who definitely knew how to manage his day.

I have been daily journalling since I was 18. However I always used notebooks and journals. There are a lot of things about using "material" journals that I liked. There is something about writing your tasks and entries, that makes the process intentional and more meaningful. Also a book is more flexible. However I was also looking at apps the entire time, since I couldn't ignore the obvious benefits of digital apps. Having ease of access, ability to more interactively track your progess, or things like setting reminders etc. I couldn't find something that had the perfect blend of both the features.    
What I required was an app that didn't feel too artificial will all these buttons, dropdowns, spinners etc; which made writing down tasks mean something more, that makes you put a little more effort and in-turn gives you more accountability for you tasks and plans.

**Enter benji.**

Benji uses a physical notebook analogous approach, with *pages* where you can plan your day or projects/growth-sprints, write down habits, shopping lists etc. It has a single unified input interface where you can use a simple system **leveraged by the power of machine learning** to plan/journal.

FEATURES:
1) Write your task in a single place, using simple constructs.
2) Navigate through a minimalist UI with the exact amount of features required.
3) Have a flexible system and interface that lets you use the app in a number of ways. As a daily planner, journal, mood tracker, sprint planner, habit diary, etc
4) Write down due-dates, event dates, habit frequencies and other time constructs in your task and events in natural language and have reminders set for you accordingly.
5) Using simple constructs and natural language in your task to set key : value pairs, that can be used to track your progress(in the form of pseudo-charts.

### How
Benji uses a simple four point system:
1) **Write a title for your app.** *date* for daily journaling, *habit* for habits, *any name* for timed sprints. After the title you can also include other tags.
2) **Start a task with a "+".** Use natural language. Eg. "go for flamenco class at 4".
3) **Finish a task by putting an "x" in the end. Move it forward with ">>".**
4) **Start a comment with the "-".** You can include information about your day/projects that can be use to track your progess. Or anything else.
5) **Use #hashtags to tag your app and make the entries searchable.** Eg. #goals, #google. You can also use predifined tags such as #done, #important etc.

### Conclusion
Benji is for all those people that want a simple, minimalist and intentional experience as they move towards their dreams.
